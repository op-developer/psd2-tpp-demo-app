 * PSD2 Payment Initiation Service
 * __NOTE__: Calling PSD2 APIs with Postman is not supported at this time.   PSD2 Payment Initiation Service allows Third-Party Providers to create and submit SEPA payments. Check our [PSD2 page](/psd2) for more information about the APIs and the regulation.   Using this API requires authenticating the client application, and end user authentication and authorization.   [See the full workflow for PSD2 PIS API >](/p/paymentauthorizationflow)   If you encounter a **technical problem** with our PSD2 APIs, please [report the issue here](https://www.op.fi/private-customers/customer-service/report-a-problem). Include at least the following information: - System: __API Management__ - Service: __PSD2 Payments__ - Description of the issue: _Your description here_  ## Sandbox PSD2 APIs are available in sandbox free of charge for both licensed and unlicensed developers. You only need to [create a developer app](/developers/apps/create), [get test certificates](/p/psd2-tpp-setup) and [register](/p/psd2-tpp-setup#user-content-tpp-registration).  ## Production access Following the regulation, using PSD2 APIs is free of charge also in production. However, a Third-Party Provider has to apply for an AISP/PISP license from a financial authority (e.g. [FIN-FSA](https://www.finanssivalvonta.fi/en/regulation/regulatory-framework/psd2/) in Finland) and obtain valid [QWAC and QSEAL certificates](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-browser/#/). Once you have the necessary licenses and certificates, contact us at tpp-support@op.fi and we will send you instructions on how to start using the APIs in production.  ##Â General guidelines related to payments Guidelines for payments can be found in OP\'s site: https://www.op.fi/documents/20556/27664758/Countries+Bank+Details+C2B+SEPA+and+Cross-border+Payments/87860cbf-5a0a-c674-d65a-f3263c3141c5 Please note that this is a general guideline and some of the instructions can be payment type, service or channel specific and are not necessarily applicable to payments that are initiated through PSD2 Payments API.
